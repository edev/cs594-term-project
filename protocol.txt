<< TABLE OF CONTENTS >>

* Introduction

    This specification describes the Internet Relay Class (IRC) protocol,
    not to be confused with the common Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol. The
    protocol utilizes a client-server architecture whereby the server relays
    messages among clients.

    The list of features follows.

* Required features

    The protocol below defines, and the client and server implement, the
    following required features of the rubric. The following listing maps
    rubric line items to the message types below that provide the corresponding
    functionality:

    3.  Client can connect to a server: Greeting, Accept Greeting, 
        Decline Greeting.

    4.  Client can create a room: Join Room.

        Explanation: If the room does not exist, it will be created.

    5.  Client can list all rooms: Request Room List, Room List.

    6.  Client can join a room: Join Room.

    7.  Client can leave a room: Leave Room.

    8.  Client can list members of a room: Request Room Member List, Room
        Member List

    10. Client can send messages to a room: Say, Said.

    11. Client can join multiple (selected) rooms: Join Room.

    12. Client can send distinct messages to multiple (selected) rooms: Say,
        Said.

    13. Client can disconnect from a server: Disconnect.

    14. Server can disconnect from clients: Disconnect.

    The implementation is responsible for the following rubric line items, as
    they do not require changes to protocol design:

    2.  Server Process

        In the reference implementation of the protocol, the server process is
        defined in /lib/server.rb and run via /server. It is a single-process,
        multi-threaded application that communicates via TCP sockets. The main
        thread accepts connections and spawns a new thread for each. A separate
        "prompt thread" accepts terminal input on the server side and processes
        it, though the only supported commands are /exit and /quit, both of
        which gracefully shut down the server.

    9.  Multiple clients can connect to a server

        The protocol places no restrictions on the number of conccurent clients
        on a server. In the reference implementation, the practical limit is
        determined by the naive data structures used to track clients and
        rooms, the performance of Ruby threads, or the use of a global lock
        to synchronize all data structures.

    15. Server can gracefully handle client crashes.

        When a client crashes, the server treats it just like a graceful client
        disconnect, sending all remaining clients a Notice message to inform
        them that a client has disconnected.

    16. Client can gracefully handle server crashes.

        Although the client cannot continue to operate without a connection
        to a server, it detects the disconnection, informs the user, and
        exits peacefully rather than crashing.

* Extra features

    The protocol additionally provides private messaging through the Whisper
    and Whispered messages.

* Reference implementation

    The reference implementation, written in Ruby, is available at:

    https://github.com/edev/cs594-term-project

    It is written for Ruby 2.6.3.

* General conventions

    All fields in all messages are required unless they are noted as optional.

    If a required field is blank, empty, or missing, the recipient must ignore
    the message.

* Communication flow

    All communication between server and client takes place over a direct TCP
    connection between the two. Allowed messages are restricted to the
    following flow:

    1.  Immediately after establishing a connection to the server, the client
    sends a Greeting message.

    2.  The server either accepts or declines the Greeting, notifying the 
        client by sending the corresponding response message. If the server
        declines the Greeting, it should close the TCP connection after sending
        its response message.

    3.  Upon receiving a greeting response:

        a.  accept: the client may now send any client message except
            another greeting.

        b.  decline: the client should expect the server to close the
            connection. The client may also terminate the connection itself.

    Either party may send Disconnect messages at any time an open TCP
    connection exists; these messages are not subject to the control flow
    above. When any party sends or receives a Disconnect message, all
    communication among the involved parties must cease immediately, and
    both parties must terminate the connection gracefully. When a client
    sends the server a Disconnect message, the server must end the connection
    with the client but remain operational and connected to any other clients
    that may be connected to the server.

    If any party receives a message that violates this communication flow, the
    recipient must ignore the message.

* Rooms

    A room, AKA a chat room, is a named list of clients. Messages sent to a
    room will be broadcast to all other clients in the room. A client may join
    or leave the room at will. A room will exist for as long as at least one
    client is present in the room.

    The default room is a nameless room that clients automatically join and
    may not leave. The list of clients in the default room is the list of
    clients connected to the server who have been sent an Accept Greeting
    message.

* Success, Error, and Notice messages

    Certain messages have expected responses. For instance, a client that
    sends a Greeting message (at the correct time) can expect a Greeting
    Response message. However, the protocol intentionally lacks specific
    responses for most messages in order to avoid unnecessary complexity in
    the protocol's design. Instead, the protocol defines general-purpose
    Success, Error, and Notice messages that the server may send to clients
    for informational purposes at its own discretion. See the relevant
    message types for details.

* Messages

*.* Greeting

    Sent by: client

    The purpose of the greeting message is to request to join chat and
    provide the server with the opportunity to accept or decline. The message
    is kept as brief as possible for version compatibility. 

*.*.* Format

    {
        "type": "greeting",
        "version": version_number 
        "displayName": name
    }

*.*.* Fields

    - version_number: a string indicating which version of the protocol the
      client is using. Ex: "0.0.1"

    - name: the name by which client would like to be known. The protocol does
      not restrict name length, but servers may set their own, arbitrary
      restrictions on name, e.g. on length, format, content, etc. A name may
      not contain whitespace characters. Ex: "joe_smith"

*.* Greeting Responses
        
    Sent by: server

    The server either accepts or declines a greeting. If the server does not
    support the specified protocol version, it must decline the greeting.
    Otherwise, the server may accept or decline the greeting based on its own,
    arbitrary policies.

*.*.* Accept Greeting

    Indicates that the server accept the client's greeting.

*.*.*.* Format

    {
        "type": "greetingResponse",
        "response": "accept"
    }

*.*.* Decline Greeting

    Indicates that the server declines the client's greeting.

*.*.*.* Format

    {
        "type": "greetingResponse",
        "response": "decline",
        "reason": reason
    }

*.*.*.*.* Fields

    - reason: a human-readable explanation string suitable to be displayed as
      an error message.

*.* Join Room

    Sent by: client

    Indicates that the client wishes to join the named room. The room will be
    created if it does not already exist.

    Sent by: client

    Requests a complete list of all current rooms on the server.

    The server's respones is a Room List message.

*.*.* Format

    {
        "type": "requestRoomList"
    }

    {
        "type": "requestRoomMemberList",
        "name": name
    }

*.*.* Fields

    name: the name of the room. To specify the default room, use "".

    message.

*.*.* Format

    {
        "type": "roomMemberList",
        "room": room,
        "members": roomMemberList
    }

    in the room except the client who sent the Say message.

*.*.* Format

    {
        "type": "say",
        "room": room,
        "message": message

*.* Whispered

    Sent by: server

    Informs a client that another client has sent them a private message.

*.*.* Format

    {
        "type": "whispered",

        "from": sender,
        "message": message
    }

*.*.* Fields

    - sender: the name of the client who sent the message.

    - message: the message being sent to the receiver.

*.* Disconnect

    Sent by: server or client

    Informs the receiving party that the sending party intends to terminate
    the connection.

*.*.* Format

    {
        "type": "disconnect",
    }

* * Generic Success and Error Responses

    When the server receives a message from a client, the server may, at its
    own discretion, send either a Success message or an Error message to the
    client. This message notifies the client of the outcome of the client's
    message. The client must clearly and promptly display Success and Error
    messages when it receives them. 

    Note to implementers: these responses are not intended to uniquely
    identify a specific client message. 

*.*.* Success

    Sent by: server

    Notifies a client that a previous message was successfully processed. 

*.*.*.* Format

    {
        "type": "success",
        "message": message
    }

*.*.*.* Fields

    - message: the text to be displayed in the client application.

*.*.* Error

    Sent by: server

    Notifies a client that a previous message could not be processed. 

*.*.*.* Format

    {
        "type": "error",
        "message": message
    }

*.*.*.* Fields

    - message: the text to be displayed in the client application.

*.* Notice

    Sent by: server

    Provides an informational message to a client. The client must clearly
    and promptly display Notice messages when it receives them.

    Note to implementers: servers are never required to send notice messages;
    these are simply provided as a way for the server to talk directly to
    clients when needed. It is permissible for a server not to use this
    message type. However, a client must correctly process notice messages
    as specified here.

*.*.* Format

    {
        "type": "notice",
        "message": message
    }

*.*.* Fields

    - message: the text to be displayed in the client application.

* Handling errors

    Both the client and the server must detect the closure of the TCP
    connection. If the client detects a closed TCP connection, it must exit
    gracefully. If the server detects a closed TCP connection to a client,
    it must remove that client from all rooms (including the default room),
    and remove any rooms that become empty as a result of this process. It may
    inform other clients of the client's departure via a Notice mssage, but
    this is left to the discretion of the implementer.

* Security

    This protocol makes no consideration for security, as security is beyond
    the purview of the class project. This protocol is not suitable for
    production use, nor is the reference implementation of either the client
    or the server.

* Conclusion

    This specification provides a JSON-based protocol for sending text messages
    among clients, using a server as a central relay.
